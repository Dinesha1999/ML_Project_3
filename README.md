Income Prediction System: Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Random Forest Model

Developed a machine learning model to predict individuals' income using a comprehensive approach involving data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify feature correlations and applied one-hot encoding for categorical data transformation. Built and fine-tuned a Random Forest Classifier using hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. Evaluated model accuracy to ensure precise income predictions, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis, model development, and performance evaluation.
